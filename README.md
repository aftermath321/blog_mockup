Hello,

This is a simple Blog mock up. At the moment it is only the initial draft of the front page. More will be gradually added.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
